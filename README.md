# Learning Design Rules
This repository contains the code used to implement an algorithm designed to learn about design choices and implementations for a project base. There are two central files in this repository: one contains the program driver, while the other contains the implementations for the functions used in the program files. All updates made to the current methodology are made in the forms of commits to the code. The proper inputs for the program and a description of the driver follow.
